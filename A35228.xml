            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the <hi>Saracens</hi> were miſreck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 10000 <hi>Francks,</hi> in the payment of 200000 thouſand pounds for a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, he would not embarke or ſet ſaile untill the aforeſaid <hi>Francks</hi> were paid: ſuch was his fidelity to thoſe Infidells. This King having appoynted a Biſhop to goe take a Muſter of the Souldiers in <hi>Paris,</hi> a great Noble-man deſired a Commiſſion to reforme the Biſhops Church, ſaying that employment was as fit for him, as the other was for the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57381:146"/>
Biſhop. When this King was <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> he taking great pleaſure in hunting, often reſorted to a poore Forreſters Cottage, where he did uſe to eate Radiſhes, he comming to be <hi>King,</hi> the Forreſter perſwaded by his Wife, &amp; in hope of reward, preſented to the <hi>King</hi> a faire Radiſh, which his Majeſty accepted, and rewarded the Forreſter with a thouſand Crownes. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a Courtier preſented the <hi>King</hi> with a faire goodly Horſe, expecting a greater reward, becauſe he had beene ſo bountifull to the Forreſter. But the <hi>King</hi> contrary to his expectation, gave the Courtier his Radiſh, wrapped up in white paper; the Courtier returning to his lodging, opening the packet, found nothing but a Radiſh, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he informed the King of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, as he ſuppoſed: The King ſaid, I have paide thee well for thy horſe: for the preſent which I gave thee coſt mee a thouſand Crownes; thus the poore mans good affection was wel rewarded,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57381:147"/>
and the Courtiers audaciouſneſſe ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Lewis</hi> ſends an Embaſſadour to the Emperour, to excuſe him for not ſending an army, promiſed by treaty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him not to make a greement with the Duke of <hi>Burgogne;</hi> but that he ſhould confiſcate all the Dukes Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nories that held of the Emperour, as hee would doe thoſe that held of the Crowne of <hi>France:</hi> The Emperour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they muſt not divide the Beares skinne before the Beaſt be dead. This King commming to an interview of the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> unto whom hee was formerly ſtrickly allyed, conceived a contempt and diſdaine each of other: The <hi>French</hi> of the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and pride, in their words, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and apparrell: The <hi>Caſtilians</hi> of the plainneſſe of the <hi>French</hi> attire: So as from that day theſe Kings did never love, and the <hi>French</hi> did ever ſince hate the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>

               <p>It was pleaded againſt him, <hi>Qui nec virtute nec fide prodeſt, proſit exemplo: He that can never profit by his vertue, nor his loyalty, muſt profit by his example;</hi> and thereupon he was condemned, and

put into the ſaid Baſtile, whither the Chancellour comming to pronounce the ſentence of death againſt him, hee ſhaked the Chancellour by the Arme, ſaying, You have judged me, and God will abſolve me; hee will lay open their iniquities, which have ſhut their eyes, becauſe they would not ſee my innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: You my Lord ſhall anſwer for this injuſtice before him, whither I doe ſummon you within a yeare and a day.

Afterward he ſaid, I ſee well that I am not the moſt wicked, but I am the moſt unfortunate. Thoſe that have done worſe than I would have done, are favoured, the Kings Clemency is dead for me. He doth not imitate <hi>Caeſar</hi> nor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or thoſe great Princes, who not onely pardoned the intention of doing ill, but the Act; and wherein can the King ſhew himſelfe greater than in

pardoning? Clemency is a Kingly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; every one may give Death, but it belongs onely to Soveraignty to give life: But the Chancellour told him, that a condemned man muſt not diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Judgment, whereupon the Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> delivered up the Kings order. Afterward the Chancellour ſaid that hee had brought two Divines to comfort him, and prepare him for death, but the Duke ſaid, That he was already prepared, and that his ſoule was in ſuch tranquillity, as the night before hee had ſpoken with God. Within few daies after he was beheaded, and his body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred by night in the Church of <hi>S. Paul.</hi>

               <p>The King intended ſhortly after to enter into his Army, but he would firſt ſee his Queene ſhould bee crowned at <hi>St. Denis,</hi> which was performed with great ſolemnity.

               <p>Many of the Lords retired from the Court, as the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and <hi>Bovillon,</hi> with other Lords, whereof ſome retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe, the others not: which was
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57381:177"/>
a cauſe that the King in Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the cauſes wherefore he kept the Prince his brother in hold.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the yeare 1617. he made a Declaration againſt the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> in Parliament, the 17. of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> alſo in <hi>February</hi> againſt the Dukes of <hi>Vendoſme, Mayenne, Bouillon,</hi> the Marqueſſe of <hi>Caevure,</hi> and the Preſident <hi>le Jay.</hi> Alſo another Declaration was made in <hi>March</hi> for the re-union to his <hi>Domaines,</hi> and a Confiſcation of the goods of the ſaid Nobility upon the 16. of the ſaid Moneth.</p>
               <p>This King ſucceeded after the Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call death of his Father, when great troubles were like to follow; but all thoſe clouds were blowne away, and this young Prince ſhined forth like the Sun in a cleare ſkie. Firſt of all hee went to the Parliament, and made a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that his Mother ſhould be Queene Regent during his minority. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Jeſuites received his Fathers

heart, with great Ceremony, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into <hi>La Flech.</hi> Here the Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and cruell Execution of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer <hi>Ravilliac</hi> deſerves to be drawne forth in blacke colours. Imagine that <hi>Ravilliac</hi> was firſt arraign'd after he had beene put to the Rack, then condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, afterward hee was brought out of the priſon in his ſhirt, with a Torch of two pound weight lighted in one hand, and the knife wherewith he had murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King, chained to the other: then he was ſet upright in a Dung-cart, now hee is doing pennance at our <hi>Ladies Church;</hi> now imagine the raging people are ready to teare him in peeces, but the Officers reſtraine them; the Murderer came to the Scaffold, he croſſes himſelfe in ſigne that he dyed a Papiſt; hee was bound to a St. <hi>Andrews Croſſe,</hi> then his fatall hand with the knife chained to it, ſmoaks in a Furnace of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; it is conſum'd, yet hee will not confeſſe any thing, but roare and cry like
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57381:178"/>
to a Soule in hell, but yet unpitied: and then his fleſh was pulld off with hot Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and burnt, then ſcalding Oyle, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, pitch, and brimſtone, melted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were powr'd into his wounds, and on his navell a roundell of Clay was ſet, into the which they powred molten Lead, and then he roared, but confeſſed nothing. At laſt, to conclude this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, his body was torne in pieces with foure ſtrong Horſes, which could not plucke them aſunder, being ſo firmely knit together, untill the fleſh under his armes and thighes was cut. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was this Paricide tormented and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, being the horrid picture of a Traytor, ſuffering extreame tortures, yet miſery nor death could not enforce from him any confeſſion. And ſurely if Hells tortures might be felt on earth, it was approved in this mans puniſhment, yet he would reveale nothing, but that he did it by the inſtigation of the Devil, and his maine reaſon was, becauſe the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57381:178"/>
King tollerated two Religions in his Kingdome. Oh ſmall occaſion, that for this cauſe one ſervile ſlave ſhould thu quench the great light of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe brightneſſe gliſtred thorow <hi>Europe:</hi> One thing this Villaine confeſſed, that of all the ſeverall torments that were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and laid upon him, none was more terrible to him, than his loſſe of ſleepe for ſixe dayes and nights together, for there were appointed ſeverall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers by turnes to keepe him waking, by thruſting red-hot bodkins into his breaſts and ſides; ſo that if he did but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to winke or give a nod, then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they awaked him with thoſe Irons. He was torne in peeces as I ſaid before, and his bones burnt, the aſhes whereof were ſcattered in the winde, as being thought unworthy of the earths buriall. This <hi>Ravaillac</hi> was borne at <hi>Angoleſme,</hi> and by profeſſion a Lawyer, and was perſwaded as it is thought, by the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites to perpetrate this bloody act, by
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57381:179"/>
murdering this Kings Father, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the hope of Learning, and the glory of Armes. Afterward the Duke of <hi>Fener,</hi> Embaſſadour from <hi>Spaine,</hi> came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and being brought into the Kings preſence, he ſaid that he came from the King his Maſter to viſite his Majeſty. This young <hi>Prince</hi> anſwered, I thanke the King my brother for his good will, I will remember him and you alſo: Seeing he deſires it, he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from me all friendſhip and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, ſuch as hee had with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed King my Father. Afterward the Lord <hi>Wotton,</hi> Embaſſadour from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and then Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for confirmation of mutuall league being ſent into <hi>Spaine, England,</hi> and to <hi>Rome,</hi> the King was at <hi>Rheims</hi> with ſolemne pompe and great ſtate crowned.</p>
